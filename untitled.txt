Untitled

I am not an artist,
nor am I a poet
I cannot be such
for I can only be something else

I am the paint that colours the wind
with every word I speak,
the very blood I spill, as rose rots into rust,
as dawn rises for the sun to set

as the sun shines and brings happiness
as life blooms from the dewdrops by the canopy
as the sky waves away the gloom and sorrow,
and magic is the cast upon this dark world

I am
As nonesense makes sense,
even if it was never meant to,
I am

I am not an artist,
nor am I a poet
for I can only be something else
for I can only be the very poetry itself

Bla-bla-bla-bla-bla
